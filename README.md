The UNO Card Generator is a Python-based GUI project designed to simulate the random distribution of UNO cards and showcase them visually.
The project emulates the 108-card deck, including four colored suits (red, yellow, green, and blue), each containing numerical cards (0-9), action cards (Skip, Draw Two, Reverse), and Wild cards (Wild, Wild Draw Four).
Using the tkinter library, the interface features a button that generates four arrays of cards, each array consisting of 8 randomly selected cards.

Additionally, the program classifies cards by rarity (common, rare, wild) and integrates images for a visually engaging experience.
By clicking the button, users can view the cards displayed as images with their corresponding rarity. 
This project demonstrates practical GUI design, randomization, and file management in Python.
