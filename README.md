The UNO Card Generator is a Python-based GUI project designed to simulate the random distribution of UNO cards and showcase them visually.
The project emulates the 108-card deck, including four colored suits (red, yellow, green, and blue), each containing numerical cards (0-9), action cards (Skip, Draw Two, Reverse), and Wild cards (Wild, Wild Draw Four).
Using the tkinter library, the interface features a button that generates four arrays of cards, each array consisting of 8 randomly selected cards.

Additionally, the program classifies cards by rarity (common, rare, wild) and integrates images for a visually engaging experience.
By clicking the button, users can view the cards displayed as images with their corresponding rarity. 
This project demonstrates practical GUI design, randomization, and file management in Python.

This is old and needs updating. In order to proceed, i will rewrite the entire code and make a fresh set


Day 01- Remade the code for taking input as the number and picking randomly from the array of the uno card types

Day 02- dealt with pygui for enhancing the Gui of the current project
